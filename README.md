Usage
--------
To make a dataset:
 Open jupyter notebook "./MakeData/make_data.ipynb" and run the entire contents. Then, you will see the data in “. /train/traindata”.

To train a Neural Network:
　"$bash TrainNN/train/trains.sh" to start learning. 

To analyze trained Neural Networks:
 Open jupyter notebook "./AnalyzeNN/Analyze.ipynb" and run the entire contents. Then, you will see the estimation results of Hamiltonians there.
